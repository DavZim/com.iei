# Independent Event Identifier (Java implementation)

This is a code snippet that implements the "IEI"-function into Java. It takes roughly 25 milliseconds for a dataset containing 100,000 rows, beating the (yet) fastest R implementation (84 milliseconds) by roughly 3.5 times.

The R implementation can be obtained from my [Github page](https://github.com/DavZim/Independent-Event-Identifier-IEI-), which also explains the ideas of such an identifier. The idea of an independent event identifier was inspired by Grigory (see more at his [Github page](https://github.com/gregcodes/counter_challenge)).
